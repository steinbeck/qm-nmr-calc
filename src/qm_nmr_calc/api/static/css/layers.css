/*
 * CSS Cascade Layers - Order Declaration
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file MUST be loaded first before any other CSS files.
 * The layer order declared here determines cascade priority:
 * - reset: lowest priority (browser normalization)
 * - base: element defaults
 * - layout: page structure and grids
 * - components: reusable UI components
 * - utilities: highest priority (single-purpose overrides)
 *
 * Styles in later layers override earlier layers regardless of specificity.
