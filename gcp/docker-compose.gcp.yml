# Docker Compose GCP overrides for qm-nmr-calc
# Uses persistent disk for data storage and sets production environment
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gcp.yml up -d
#
# This override file is automatically created by the startup script and configures:
# - Persistent disk bind mounts (/mnt/disks/data instead of named volume)
# - Production environment variables
# - Info-level logging for production

    volumes:
      # Override to use mounted persistent disk instead of named volume

    environment:

  # Caddy DOMAIN comes from .env file (already set in base compose)
  # Named volumes (caddy_data, caddy_config) remain as Docker volumes for certificate storage
