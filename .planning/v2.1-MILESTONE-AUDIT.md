## Integration Verification

The integration checker verified all cross-phase wiring. Key findings:

### Wiring Status

- **Connected:** 100% of phase exports are properly used
- **Orphaned:** 0 exports created but unused
- **Missing:** 0 critical connections

### E2E Flows Verified

1. **Submit → Status → Results:** Complete
2. **Glass effects rendering:** Consistent across pages (44 glass-card instances)
3. **Design token flow:** 311 var() references, all working
4. **Responsive breakpoints:** Working at all screen sizes
5. **Accessibility patterns:** Consistent across all interactive elements

### CSS Chain Verified

```
base.html loads:
  1. layers.css      → Layer order declaration
  2. reset.css       → CSS reset
  3. tokens.css      → 62 design tokens
  4. base.css        → Element defaults
  5. layout.css      → Bento grid system
  6. glass-card.css  → Glassmorphism component
  7. [page CSS]      → Page-specific styles
  8. utilities.css   → Utility classes
  9. legacy.css      → Migrated Pico styles
```

All chains verified working.

## Gaps Analysis

### Critical Gaps: 0

No critical issues that would block deployment.

### Minor Gaps (Non-blocking)

| Gap | Phase | Impact | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| Bento grid uses span utilities vs named grid areas | 18 | None - functionally equivalent | Acceptable |
| Breakpoint inconsistency (767px vs 768px) | General | Negligible (1px) | Tech debt |
| viewer-card in results-page.css not components/ | 19 | Organizational preference | Tech debt |

### Resolved Gaps

| Gap | Original Phase | Resolution |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| --pico-del-color reference in submit.html | 18 | Fixed in Phase 20 - no Pico refs remain |

## Tech Debt Summary

**Total Items:** 3 (all low priority)

### Phase 18: CSS Foundation

- Bento grid uses span utilities (--span-2, --span-4, etc.) rather than CSS `grid-template-areas` with named regions. This is a functional alternative that works well.

### General

- Minor breakpoint inconsistency: some files use 767px, others 768px for mobile breakpoint. Impact is negligible (1px difference).
- viewer-card component is defined in results-page.css and shared via CSS import to status.html. Could be moved to components/ for clarity.

## Human Verification Completed

All human verification was completed during phase execution:

- **Phase 19:** Visual checkpoint approved for results page
- **Phase 20:** SmilesDrawer preview tested and working
- **Phase 21:** Step tracker and progress bar verified during v2.0.1 testing
- **Phase 22:** Mobile responsive layout approved
- **Phase 23:** Contrast ratio, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, Safari rendering all validated

## Deliverables

### CSS Files Created (Phase 18)

- `css/layers.css` - CSS layer declarations
- `css/reset.css` - Minimal CSS reset
- `css/tokens.css` - 62 design tokens
- `css/base.css` - Element defaults
- `css/layout.css` - Bento grid system
- `css/components/glass-card.css` - Glassmorphism component
- `css/utilities.css` - Utility classes
- `css/legacy.css` - Migrated Pico styles

### Page CSS Created (Phases 19-21)

- `css/pages/results-page.css` - Results page + viewer-card
- `css/pages/submit-page.css` - Submit form layout
- `css/pages/status-page.css` - Step tracker + progress

### Templates Updated

- `templates/base.html` - New CSS loading order
- `templates/results.html` - Bento grid layout
- `templates/submit.html` - Two-column form layout
- `templates/status.html` - Step tracker + progress

## Conclusion

**v2.1 UI Redesign is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION-READY.**

All 35 requirements are satisfied. All 6 phases verified. All E2E flows working. Minor tech debt items are organizational preferences that do not affect functionality or user experience.

The milestone delivers:
- Modern bento grid layout system
- Glassmorphism effects with Safari compatibility
- WCAG-compliant accessibility (contrast, focus, reduced motion)
- Mobile-optimized performance (reduced blur, responsive breakpoints)
- Professional scientific aesthetic
