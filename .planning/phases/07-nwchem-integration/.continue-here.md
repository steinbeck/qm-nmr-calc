# Continue Here - Phase 7 Discussion

**Paused:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Mid-discussion for Phase 7 (NWChem Integration)

## Discussion Progress

We're running `/gsd:discuss-phase 7` to capture implementation decisions.

**Areas selected for discussion:** All 4
1. ISiCLE code adaptation ✓ COMPLETE
2. Module organization ✓ COMPLETE
3. Pre-optimized geometry handling ✓ COMPLETE
4. COSMO solvation details ◆ IN PROGRESS (2 of 4 questions answered)

## Decisions Captured So Far

### ISiCLE Code Adaptation
- **Study approach:** Extract as needed (start writing, refer to ISiCLE when stuck)
- **Extraction scope:** Minimal extraction (only what we need for our methods)
- **Attribution:** README mention only (no in-code comments)
- **ISiCLE dependency:** Remove completely (clean break)

### Module Organization
- **Code structure:** Claude decides (single vs split files)
- **Migration strategy:** Replace immediately (delete isicle_wrapper.py, no coexistence)
- **SMILES-to-3D location:** In NWChem module (full pipeline in one place)
- **API design:** Redesign freely (update callers as needed)

### Pre-optimized Geometry Handling
- **Detection method:** Explicit flag (skip_optimization=true parameter)
- **Supported formats:** XYZ and SDF
- **Skip scope:** NMR always runs (can only skip geometry optimization)
- **Validation level:** Basic validation (check file parses, valid coordinates)

### COSMO Solvation Details (INCOMPLETE)
- **Solvent scope:** CHCl3 + DMSO only (match v1.1 milestone scope)
- **Solvent API:** Required parameter (no default, forces user choice)
- **Invalid solvent handling:** NOT YET ANSWERED
- **[More questions may remain]**

## Resume Instructions

Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 7` again.

The assistant should:
1. Note this .continue-here.md exists
2. Acknowledge the decisions already made
3. Continue from COSMO solvation details - ask about invalid solvent handling
4. After COSMO complete, offer to create CONTEXT.md with all captured decisions

## Decisions Ready for CONTEXT.md

Once discussion completes, write to `.planning/phases/07-nwchem-integration/07-CONTEXT.md` with:

- Phase boundary: Replace ISiCLE with direct NWChem handling
- ISiCLE adaptation decisions
- Module organization decisions
- Pre-optimized geometry decisions
- COSMO solvation decisions
- Claude's discretion items (code structure)
