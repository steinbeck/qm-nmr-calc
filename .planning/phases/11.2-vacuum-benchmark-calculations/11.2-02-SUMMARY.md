# Plan 11.2-02 Summary: Execute Vacuum Benchmark

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** ~4 hours (includes NWChem calculation time)
**Date:** 2026-01-25

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Pilot Vacuum Calculations (5 molecules)

Initial run with 8 MPI processes failed due to resource contention (another NWChem job was running with 40 processes). Errors included:
- "MO vectors mismatch" - CPHF calculation failures
- "rtdb type mismatch" - Database corruption from parallel conflicts

**Resolution:** Reduced to 4 MPI processes and ran calculations serially. All 5 pilot molecules (compound_01 through compound_05) completed successfully.

### Task 2: Full Vacuum Benchmark (remaining 45 molecules)

Ran full benchmark in headless mode with 4 MPI processes:
```bash
run_benchmark(functionals=['B3LYP'], solvents=['vacuum'], processes=4, headless=True, resume=True)
```

**Results:**
- Total: 50/50 molecules complete
- Failed: 0
- Average calculation time: ~7 minutes per molecule (vacuum faster than solvated)
- Total elapsed time: ~4 hours

### Task 3: Human Verification

Verified all 50 shifts.json files exist and contain valid shielding_data:
- All files present in `data/benchmark/results/compound_*/B3LYP_vacuum/shifts.json`
- All files contain H and C atom shielding values
- Status.json shows state="complete", failed=0

## Key Observations

1. **Vacuum calculations are faster** - No COSMO solvation overhead reduces calculation time
2. **Resource contention matters** - Running NWChem with too many MPI processes while other jobs are active causes failures
3. **4 processes is reliable** - Works well on this system even with concurrent jobs

## Output Files

- 50 shifts.json files in `data/benchmark/results/compound_XX/B3LYP_vacuum/`
- Each contains raw shielding_data (no shift conversion yet - scaling factors to be derived in Plan 03)
- status.json shows benchmark completion

## Next Steps

Plan 11.2-03 will:
1. Load vacuum shielding data from all 50 molecules
2. Derive scaling factors via linear regression (slope, intercept)
3. Validate with MAE/RMSD statistics
4. Add vacuum scaling factors to production system
