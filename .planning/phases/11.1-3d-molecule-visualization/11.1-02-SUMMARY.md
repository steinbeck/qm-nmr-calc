# Plan 11.1-02 Summary: Frontend 3D Visualization

## What Was Built

Added interactive 3Dmol.js visualization to status and results pages:

### Templates Modified
- **base.html**: Added 3Dmol.js CDN script include
- **status.html**: 3D viewer showing molecule while job runs (no shift labels)
- **results.html**: 3D viewer with chemical shift labels on atoms

### Features Implemented
- Real-time 3D molecule display using geometry.json endpoint
- Stick-and-ball representation with Jmol color scheme
- Rotation and zoom controls
- Shift labels: 1H in blue, 13C in orange (results page only)
- Geometry updates from RDKit initial to NWChem optimized when complete

### Code Patterns
- `viewer.addModel(xyz, 'xyz', {assignBonds: true})` for structure loading
- `viewer.setStyle({stick, sphere})` for rendering
- `viewer.addLabel()` for shift annotations

## Known Limitations

- **Bond orders not displayed**: XYZ format lacks bond order information
  - All bonds render as single bonds
  - Double/triple bonds need SDF format or explicit bond data
  - Issue tracked for future enhancement

## Verification

- Status page shows 3D viewer during calculation
- Results page shows 3D viewer with shift labels
- Viewer allows rotation/zoom interaction
- Labels correctly positioned at atom centers

## Completed
