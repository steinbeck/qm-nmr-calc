<objective>
Add Docker quick start section to README.md that enables 5-minute deployment using pre-built GHCR images.

Purpose: The README is the first thing users see. It must show Docker as the primary deployment method with a clear, copy-pasteable sequence that gets the app running in under 5 minutes.

Output: Updated README.md with Docker quick start as the primary Getting Started path

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Docker Quick Start to README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Restructure README.md Getting Started section to prioritize Docker deployment:

1. **Replace the current "Getting Started" section** with Docker-first approach:

```markdown
## Quick Start (Docker)

Deploy qm-nmr-calc in under 5 minutes using pre-built Docker images:

```bash
# Clone repository (for docker-compose.yml and Caddyfile)
git clone https://github.com/steinbeck/qm-nmr-calc.git
cd qm-nmr-calc

# Configure (optional - defaults work for local testing)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you want to customize CPU cores, memory, or add domain for HTTPS

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Open http://localhost in your browser
```

**What's running:**
- **API** (ghcr.io/steinbeck/qm-nmr-calc-api) - FastAPI web server
- **Worker** (ghcr.io/steinbeck/qm-nmr-calc-worker) - NWChem/CREST/xTB calculation engine
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy (auto-HTTPS when domain configured)

**Stop services:** `docker compose down`
**View logs:** `docker compose logs -f`

For production deployment with HTTPS, cloud VPS setup, and troubleshooting, see the **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md)**.
```

2. **Add a "Development Installation" section** below Quick Start for manual/source installation:

```markdown
## Development Installation

For development or contributing, install from source:

**Prerequisites:** Linux, Python 3.11+, NWChem, uv

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steinbeck/qm-nmr-calc.git
cd qm-nmr-calc
uv sync

# Start services (two terminals)
uv run python scripts/run_consumer.py  # Terminal 1: Job processor
uv run python scripts/run_api.py       # Terminal 2: API server

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

See [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for detailed setup including CREST/xTB.
```

3. **Update docker-compose.yml header comment** (if not already done) to reference GHCR images by default. Actually, the current docker-compose.yml already has instructions in comments. Leave docker-compose.yml as-is for this task.

4. **Keep existing sections** (Features, Documentation, API Example, Supported Solvents, Calculation Presets, License, Acknowledgments) but ensure they flow well after the new Getting Started structure.
  </action>
  <verify>
- README.md contains "Quick Start (Docker)" section
- README.md contains `docker compose up -d` command
- README.md contains link to docs/deployment.md
- README.md preserves existing feature documentation
  </verify>
  <done>
README prominently displays Docker deployment as primary method with 5-minute quick start, links to deployment guide for advanced setup, and retains development installation as secondary option.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] README.md has Docker Quick Start section near top
- [ ] Commands are copy-pasteable and accurate
- [ ] Link to docs/deployment.md exists
- [ ] Development installation still documented
- [ ] No broken links or markdown formatting issues
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User visiting README sees Docker as the primary deployment method
- Quick start section has 4-5 commands maximum
- Both localhost (HTTP) and production (HTTPS) paths mentioned
- Detailed deployment guide linked for advanced configuration
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/40-documentation/40-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
