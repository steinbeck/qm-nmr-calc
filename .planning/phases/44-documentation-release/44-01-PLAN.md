<objective>
Update README and deployment documentation to announce ARM64/Apple Silicon support and document any ARM64-specific caveats discovered during Phase 42 validation.

Purpose: Users deploying on Apple Silicon Macs or ARM-based cloud instances (AWS Graviton) need to know that ARM64 is now supported and understand any platform-specific considerations.

Output: Updated README.md with ARM64 callout, updated docs/deployment.md with ARM64 known issues section.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README with ARM64 support announcement</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add ARM64/Apple Silicon support information to the Quick Start (Docker) section.

After the "What's running:" section, add a new subsection:

```markdown
**Platform Support:**
- **x86_64 (Intel/AMD)**: Full support
- **ARM64 (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton)**: Full support - images auto-select correct architecture
```

Keep the existing section structure intact. The key message is that `docker compose up -d` works identically on both architectures with no changes needed.

Do NOT add excessive ARM64 mentions throughout - a single callout in the Docker section is sufficient.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify README.md contains "ARM64" and "Apple Silicon" text:
```bash
grep -E "ARM64|Apple Silicon" README.md
```
Expected: At least one line mentioning ARM64/Apple Silicon support.
  </verify>
  <done>README.md Docker section mentions ARM64/Apple Silicon support with clear indication that docker-compose works unchanged.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add ARM64 Known Issues section to deployment guide</name>
  <files>docs/deployment.md</files>
  <action>
Add a new "ARM64 / Apple Silicon" section to the deployment guide BEFORE the "Related Documentation" section at the end.

Section content:

```markdown
## ARM64 / Apple Silicon

qm-nmr-calc fully supports ARM64 architecture, including Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) and ARM-based cloud instances (AWS Graviton, Ampere).

### How It Works

Docker images are published as multi-architecture manifests. When you run `docker compose up -d`, Docker automatically pulls the correct image for your platform:

- **x86_64 hosts**: Pull `linux/amd64` images
- **ARM64 hosts**: Pull `linux/arm64` images

No configuration changes needed - the same `docker-compose.yml` works on both architectures.

### Known Considerations

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Memory | NWChem requires minimum 2 GB memory per MPI process for reliable DFT calculations |
| Threading | OpenBLAS configured with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` to avoid thread contention with MPI |
| CPU detection | `NWCHEM_NPROC` auto-detects available CPUs (capped at 40) if not explicitly set |
| Numerical results | ARM64 results match x86_64 within acceptable tolerances (0.5 ppm 1H, 2.0 ppm 13C) |

### CI/CD Note

ARM64 images are built using GitHub Actions' native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners. This is **free for public repositories only**. If you fork this repository as private, ARM64 builds will not run.
```

Place this section right before "## Related Documentation".
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify docs/deployment.md contains ARM64 section with key caveats:
```bash
grep -E "ARM64|Apple Silicon|NWCHEM_NPROC|OMP_NUM_THREADS" docs/deployment.md
```
Expected: Multiple lines showing ARM64 section header and key configuration details.
  </verify>
  <done>docs/deployment.md has comprehensive ARM64/Apple Silicon section with known considerations from Phase 42 validation.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify docker-compose.yml works unchanged on ARM64</name>
  <files>docker-compose.yml</files>
  <action>
Verify that docker-compose.yml contains NO architecture-specific configuration that would require user changes on ARM64.

Check for:
1. Image references use standard tags (latest, version tags) not platform-specific tags
2. No `platform:` directives that would override auto-detection
3. No hardcoded x86-only paths or binaries

If any issues found, document them. If no issues (expected), confirm DOCS-03 requirement is satisfied.

This is a verification task, not a modification task. The file should require NO changes.
  </action>
  <verify>
Check docker-compose.yml for any architecture-specific configuration:
```bash
grep -E "platform:|amd64|x86_64" docker-compose.yml | grep -v "^#"
```
Expected: No output (no platform-specific configuration).

Also verify images use standard tags:
```bash
grep "image:" docker-compose.yml
```
Expected: Images reference ghcr.io/steinbeck/qm-nmr-calc-* with standard tags.
  </verify>
  <done>docker-compose.yml confirmed to work unchanged on ARM64 with no architecture-specific configuration.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

All phase requirements verified:

1. **DOCS-01**: `grep "ARM64" README.md` returns ARM64/Apple Silicon callout
2. **DOCS-02**: `grep "Known Considerations" docs/deployment.md` returns known issues table
3. **DOCS-03**: `grep -E "platform:|amd64" docker-compose.yml` returns empty (no arch-specific config)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md Docker section mentions ARM64/Apple Silicon support
- docs/deployment.md has new "ARM64 / Apple Silicon" section with known considerations table
- docker-compose.yml requires no changes for ARM64 deployment
- All documentation accurately reflects Phase 42 validation findings
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/44-documentation-release/44-01-SUMMARY.md`
