<current_state>
Milestone v1.0 is COMPLETE. Preparing to migrate to new machine with fewer cores but more disk.
All code committed and pushed to GitHub. Comprehensive README created for fresh setup.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**This session:**
- Committed all outstanding changes (TMS referencing, progress tracking, solvent support)
- Added TODO note documenting gas-phase limitation in isicle_wrapper.py
- Created comprehensive README.md with full setup instructions
- Pushed all commits to GitHub (32 total commits on master)

**Milestone v1.0 (all phases):**
- Phase 1: Foundation - Project structure, dependencies, configuration
- Phase 2: Input & API - SMILES/MOL/SDF parsing, REST API endpoints
- Phase 3: NMR Calculations - ISiCLE/NWChem integration, async job queue
- Phase 4: Results Delivery - Download endpoints, email notifications
- Phase 5: Visualization - Spectrum plots, annotated molecule images
- Phase 6: Web UI - Submit form, status page, results page
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Machine migration:**
1. Set up new machine following README.md instructions
2. Generate new SSH keys, add to GitHub
3. Clone qm-nmr-calc and isicle repos
4. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
5. Verify environment with startup validation
6. Adjust `processes` in presets.py for new core count

**Future work (post-migration):**
- Investigate ~10 ppm chemical shift error
- Consider enabling COSMO solvation (currently gas phase)
- Plan v1.1 milestone features
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Comprehensive README preferred over migration script (more maintainable)
- New SSH keys on new machine (cleaner than copying)
- All code pushed before migration (nothing local-only)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - ready for migration
</blockers>

<context>
The user is migrating to a new machine with:
- Fewer CPU cores (adjust `processes` in presets.py accordingly)
- More disk space (good for NWChem scratch files)

The README.md has everything needed for setup. Key steps:
1. Install NWChem, OpenMPI, Python 3.11, uv
2. Clone ISiCLE to sibling directory
3. Clone qm-nmr-calc, run `uv sync`
4. Start consumer + API server

Known issue: Chemical shifts ~10 ppm off from experimental values.
This needs investigation after migration settles.

<next_action>
On new machine:
1. Generate SSH keys: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
2. Add public key to GitHub
3. Follow README.md installation steps
4. Run `/gsd:resume-work` to continue
</next_action>
