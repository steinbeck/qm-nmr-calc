<current_state>
Milestone v1.0 is COMPLETE. All 6 phases executed and verified.
The application is functional but has a known accuracy issue.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**This session:**
- Committed all outstanding changes (TMS referencing, progress tracking, solvent support)
- Pushed 30 commits to GitHub
- Added TODO note documenting gas-phase limitation

**Milestone v1.0 (all phases):**
- Phase 1: Foundation - Project structure, dependencies, configuration
- Phase 2: Input & API - SMILES/MOL/SDF parsing, REST API endpoints
- Phase 3: NMR Calculations - ISiCLE/NWChem integration, async job queue
- Phase 4: Results Delivery - Download endpoints, email notifications
- Phase 5: Visualization - Spectrum plots, annotated molecule images
- Phase 6: Web UI - Submit form, status page, results page
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**No planned work remaining for v1.0.**

**Known issue for future work:**
- Chemical shift predictions are ~10 ppm off from expected values
- This may be related to gas-phase calculations vs solvent effects
- Solvent parameter is accepted by API but NOT USED (cosmo=False)
- See TODO in `src/qm_nmr_calc/isicle_wrapper.py`
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Gas-phase calculations used because CHESHIRE scaling factors are gas-phase derived
- Solvent UI kept for future implementation (parameter flows through but isn't applied)
- TMS reference values computed and stored in `data/tms_reference_values.json`
- ~10 ppm error documented but not resolved - needs investigation
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Chemical shift accuracy: ~10 ppm systematic error
  - Possible causes: gas-phase vs solvent, scaling factors, TMS reference method
  - Workaround: None currently - results show raw calculated values
</blockers>

<context>
The v1.0 milestone delivers a working end-to-end NMR prediction pipeline:
1. User submits molecule (SMILES/MOL/SDF) via web form or API
2. Async job runs geometry optimization + NMR shielding calculation
3. Results show predicted chemical shifts with spectrum visualization

The ~10 ppm error needs investigation before the predictions are useful
for real chemistry applications. Likely areas to explore:
1. Enable COSMO solvation (cosmo=True) and use solvent-specific scaling
2. Verify TMS reference calculation methodology
3. Compare against literature values for known compounds
4. Consider different DFT functionals or basis sets
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming, start by:
1. Run `/gsd:progress` to see current state
2. Decide whether to investigate the ~10 ppm error or start v1.1 milestone
3. If investigating error: compare calculated shieldings against published values
4. If starting v1.1: run `/gsd:new-milestone` to plan next features
</next_action>
