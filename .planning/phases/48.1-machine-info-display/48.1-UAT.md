## Current Test

[testing complete - remaining tests deferred to GCP deployment]

## Tests

### 1. Footer displays on submit page
expected: Visit home page (/). Footer shows machine info (hostname/type, cores, RAM), NWChem allocation (processes, memory), and branding links (NWChem, Steinbeck Lab, GitHub).
result: pass (after fix)
note: Initially showed 8 GB RAM, fixed by adding macOS sysctl support

### 2. Footer displays on status page
expected: Submit a job and view status page (/status/{job_id}). Same footer appears with machine info, NWChem allocation, and branding.
result: skipped
reason: NWChem not available locally - will verify on GCP deployment

### 3. Footer displays on results page
expected: View a completed job results page (/results/{job_id}). Same footer appears with machine info, NWChem allocation, and branding.
result: skipped
reason: NWChem not available locally - will verify on GCP deployment

### 4. Footer links work correctly
expected: Click each link in footer - NWChem opens nwchemgit.github.io, Steinbeck Lab opens cheminf.uni-jena.de, GitHub opens github.com/steinbeck-lab/qm-nmr-calc. All open in new tabs.
result: skipped
reason: Will verify on GCP deployment

### 5. Footer responsive layout
expected: On desktop (>768px), footer content is side-by-side (machine info left, branding right). On mobile (<768px), content stacks vertically centered.
result: skipped
reason: Will verify on GCP deployment

## Gaps

- truth: "Footer displays correct system RAM"
  status: fixed
  reason: "User reported: RAM showing 8 GB instead of actual 24 GB"
  severity: major
  test: 1
  root_cause: "_get_available_memory_gb() only supported Linux (cgroup, /proc/meminfo), fell back to 8GB default on macOS"
  fix: "Added macOS sysctl hw.memsize detection in presets.py"
