**Paused:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Mid-milestone planning for v1.1 (Fix Shift Accuracy)

## What We Were Doing

Started `/gsd:new-milestone` to address chemical shift accuracy issues. The v1.0 system works end-to-end but produces incorrect shift values because the scaling factors are wrong.

## The Problem

The current system uses scaling factors from CHESHIRE database (gas-phase calculations) but:
1. We're using B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) with CHCl3 solvent (PCM)
2. Scaling factors depend on:
   - Level of theory (functional + basis set)
   - Solvent model (gas-phase vs PCM)
   - **Software** (NWChem vs Gaussian) ← Critical gap

## Research Findings from DELTA50 Paper

The DELTA50 paper (Cohen et al., 2023) benchmarks NMR prediction methods:

**Best methods identified (Table 7):**
- ¹H: GIAO-PCM-WP04/6-311++G(2d,p), m=-1.0311, b=32.2654
- ¹³C: GIAO-PCM-ωB97X-D/def2-SVP, m=-1.0065, b=196.0386

**Critical issue:** All benchmarking used **Gaussian 16**. These scaling factors may not apply directly to NWChem.

**Current scaling factors in code** (`presets.py`):
- H1: slope=-1.0, intercept=31.0 (from Pierens/CHESHIRE, gas-phase)
- C13: slope=-1.0, intercept=182.0 (from Pierens/CHESHIRE, gas-phase)

## User's Key Concern

> "We need to research this very carefully before continuing. So the slope/intercept values seem to depend on both the level of theory, of course the solvent, but also on the software (NWChem vs Gaussian)."

## What Needs to Happen Next

1. **Determine if scaling factors are software-dependent**
   - Check if NWChem produces different shielding tensors than Gaussian for same geometry
   - Look for NWChem-specific scaling factor literature

2. **Options to consider:**
   - Find published NWChem scaling factors for B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
   - Derive our own scaling factors by running NWChem on DELTA50 test set
   - Switch to a method with published NWChem factors
   - Consider if the software difference is actually significant

3. **Then continue with:**
   - Complete `/gsd:new-milestone` requirements definition
   - Create roadmap for accuracy fixes

## Reference Papers

Then explain: "We're fixing shift accuracy. Need to research NWChem-specific scaling factors vs Gaussian."
